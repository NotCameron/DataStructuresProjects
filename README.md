# DataStructuresProjects
Simple projects assigned to me in my Data Structures course

### Project 1
A program that uses a singly and doubly linked list to create a student record system.

### Project 2
A program that takes a reverse polish notation string and prints the result. It utilizes a stack in order to evaluate the input string and to return the result.

### Project 3
A program that reads a txt file and creates a graph. It can print the shortest path between two nodes, print the adjacency list, and do various searches.
